In this project we have to find the best machine learning model and params for a given [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0321).

# Goal

The goal of this competition is the prediction of the price of diamonds based on their characteristics (weight, color, quality of cut, etc.), putting into practice all the machine learning techniques I know.

# Evaluation metrics

The evaluation metric chosen for this competition is the MSE (Mean Squared Error).

# Requirements 

* Train a minimum of 4 different models
* Perform a minimum of 4 Feature Extraction and Engineering techniques
* Documentation needed to reproduce the code
* The code in .py and/or .ipynb files that allows to reproduce the exercise.
* Functions must be in modules. ;)
* The Readme must contain a summary of the machine learning tools and algorithms
* and the results or the score obtained with each of them.
